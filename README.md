## Features

- **Snake Movement:** Control the snake's movement using the arrow keys.
- **Food:** Eat food to grow the snake's length and increase the score.
- **Collision Detection:** Avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body.
- **Score:** Keep track of the score, with the highest score recorded.
